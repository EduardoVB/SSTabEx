TABEXCTL REFERENCE

*SSTabEx control*
- This control is a direct replacement of the original SSTab control that comes with VB6. 
All the code for the control is in the file uscSSTabEx.ctl, the other files are for property pages and subclassing.

One of the main enhancements over the original is that it displays Visual Styles (or Themes), but also other features have beed added.
The SSTabEx controls will be "themed" only if you added a manifest file for doing that for the common controls. To see the SSTabEx's themed, you need to compile and run the program compiled or to have the IDE also manifested for Common Controls 6.
Still, the VisualStyles property must be set to True for the control to be themed.

Replacing the original SSTab:

If you want to replace the original SSTab in a project with this control, you can do it following these steps:
- Make a backup of your project first.
- Add the reference to the compiled OCX or add the SSTabEx and related files in source code to your project. For the list of needed source code files please read "Readme - Notes.txt".
- If the SSTabEx is not in the same project that you'll use it, then add temporarily an SSTabEx control to a form, just dropping a new control onto it. Save the project and close the IDE.
- Manually edit the *.frm files and replace TabDlg.SSTab with ProjectName.SSTabEx, where "ProjectName" is the name of the project that has the SSTabEx control.
- If you have added it to your exe project, it will be the name of your project, but if you are using it from an OCX, it will be the name of that component.
- Re-open the project in the IDE. If you added a temporary control, delete it.

In the case that you want to have the control inside your exe, the first thing you need to do is to add the files (uscSSTabEx.ctl and the others) to your project, then you can close the project and do the editing and replacement pointed before in the *.frm files. After that, you can re-open the project.
In the case you will be using the control from an OCX file, first add the reference to that ocx file to the project (menu Project/Components), save the project and close it. Then you can do the editing and replacement in the *.frm files.
Before editing the *.frm files, make a backup copy of your project for being able to go back in case that anything goes wrong.

After you successfully replaced the control and opened your project with the new control, there is still something else that you need to change:
The original property Tab (that returns or sets the selected -or currently active- tab) now was renamed to TabSel. You need to replace in all the places that appears ControlName.Tab with ControlName.TabSel (if there is any in your code).
When Style is set to ssStylePropertyPage, the TabMaxWidth property setting is no longer ignored (as it was in the original SSTab). So if Style is set to ssStylePropertyPage, ensure that  TabMaxWidth is set to 0 (zero) when upgrading.

TabSelBackColor property:
	Type: Long
	Returns or sets the color of the active tab, including the tab body (the space were the contained controls are located).
	If ChangeControlsBackColor is True, changing this color will change also the BackColor of the contained controls.

	ssTWSNonJustified: The width of the tabs will be determined by the size of the caption + the size of the tab picture (if any). TabMinWidth and TabMaxWidth settings can set a boundary for the width that a tab can have. Unlike the original SSTab control, if the sum of the widths of all the tabs in a row exceeds the available space, the widths of the tabs in that row are shrunken to fit in the available space.
	
	ssTWSJustified: If there is more than one row, each tab is wide enough to accommodate its contents and, if needed, the width of each tab is increased so that each row of tabs spans the width of the control. If all the tabs fit in one row, the tabs are not justified (it works the same as ssTWSNonJustified).
	
	ssTWSAuto: The behavior is defined by the Style property setting.


UseMaskColor property:

	Usually the control will be themed when compiled (unless changes has been made to make the IDE to show visual styles).
	
	The following properties have no effect when the control is applying visual styles: TabAppearance, TabBackColor, TabSelBackColor and TabSelHighlight.


WordWrap property:
	Type: Boolean
	Returns or sets a value that determines how the control displays the text on each tab.
	In a control that its size and/or the tab texts change dinamically, to make sure that text will not be truncated if it is too long, set the WordWrap property to True, the TabMaxWidth property to 0, and the TabHeight property to a height that allows to view the longest piece of text.


Methods: 

IsVisualStyleApplied function:
	Return Type:	Boolean
	No parameters.

	Returns a boolean value indicating whether the visual styles are actually applied to the control or not.

Events: 

BeforeClick event:
	Parameter(s):
	    Returns value	Cancel	As	Boolean
	Occurs when the current tab (TabSel) is about to change.
	Use the BeforeClick event to validate the information on the old tab before actually generating a Click event that selects the new tab.
	Setting the Cancel parameter to True allows you to prevent the change to the new tab selection.

	This event is generated for each control on the current tab, before the tab is painted.
	The ControlName parameter specifies the name of the control, to avoid changing a particular control BackColor, set the parameter Cancel to True.
	The ControlTypeName parameter specifies the type of the control (for example "CommandButton" or "Label"), this allow you to handle a whole class of controls without writing each name.


Click event:
	Parameter(s):
	    Info	PreviousTab	As	Integer

	Parameter(s):
	    Returns value	Effect	As	Long
	    Returns value	DefaultCursors	As	Boolean
	Occurs after every OLEDragOver event. OLEGiveFeedback allows the source component to provide visual feedback to the user, such as changing the mouse cursor to indicate what will happen if the user drops the object, or provide visual feedback on the selection (in the source component) to indicate what will happen.


OLESetData event:
	Parameter(s):
	    Returns value	Data	As	DataObject
	    Returns value	DataFormat	As	Integer
	Occurs on a source component when a target component performs the GetData method on the source's DataObject object, but before the data for the specified format has been loaded.


OLEStartDrag event:
	Parameter(s):
	    Returns value	Data	As	DataObject
	    Returns value	AllowedEffects	As	Long

Resize event:
	No parameters.
	Occurs when the control is first drawn or when its size changes.


RowsChange event:
	No parameters.
	Occurs when the control is first drawn and when the Rows property changes its value.
	The Rows property value can change its value when new tabs are dinamically added or, when TabWidthStyle is set to ssTWSFixed or ssTWSNonJustified and TabsPerRow was changed, or TabWidthStyle is set to ssTWSJustified and the Width of the control changed or the tab captions changed or the Font setting has changed.
	You can use this event along with TabBodyTop to properly set the Top (or use TabBodyLeft, depending on TabOrientation) of the contained controls.
	But if AutoRelocateControls is set to True, that's is already done automaticaly.


TabBodyResize event:
	No parameters.
	Occurs when the tab body changes its size.
	The size and position of the tab body are referenced by the properties TabBodyLeft, TabBodyTop, TabBodyWidth and TabBodyHeight.
	This event is a proper place to position the contained controls.


TabMouseEnter event:
	Parameter(s):
	    Info	nTab	As	Integer
	Occurs when the mouse pointer enters a tab, which is specified with the nTab parameter.
